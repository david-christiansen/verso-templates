Hi! I'm Alex, a software engineer based in Portland, Oregon, USA. I work at a fintech company where correctness and reliability are pretty importantâ€”bugs in financial software tend to be expensive.

I have a background in applied mathematics and computer science, which led me down the rabbit hole of formal verification about a year ago. I started learning Lean 4 partly out of curiosity and partly because I wanted to better understand how to write more reliable code. I'm also very excited about having LLMs automatically produce verified code.

This blog documents my journey learning formal methods and theorem proving. I'm particularly interested in how these techniques can apply to everyday programming problems, not just abstract mathematical theorems. My goal is to explore concepts like verified algorithms, correctness proofs for data structures, and ways to bring more mathematical rigor to software development.

When I'm not coding or proving theorems, you can usually find me hiking around the Columbia River Gorge or experimenting with new coffee brewing methods (Portland stereotypes exist for a reason).

I discovered Verso recently and was excited by the possibility of writing technical content where the code and proofs are actually run/checked every time I regenerate the site's HTML. No more wondering if that code snippet in a blog post actually compiles!
