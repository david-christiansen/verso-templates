# A Verso Blog

This directory contains a blog written in Verso, in the spirit of
personal sites built with static site generators like Jekyll.

**This simple blog is written in only a single version of Lean.** As a
result, the code examples in it may need updating from time to time
when updating Lean versions. Please see TODO for an example of a blog
that "snapshots" the Lean version used for older posts.
